Before you begin looking at homes, make a list of your priorities: location, size, lot, amenities, etc. Establish a set of minimum requirements and a 'wish list'. Minimum requirements are things that a house must have for you to consider it, while a 'wish list' covers things that you'd like to have but aren't essential.",
